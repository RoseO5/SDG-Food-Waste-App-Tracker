## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Food waste is one of the most pressing global challenges:  
- According to the UN, **over 1.3 billion tons of food** is wasted globally each year.  
- In Nigeria and many other developing countries, food waste happens along the entire supply chain â€” from production to households.  
- This waste contributes not only to **hunger** (as millions lack adequate nutrition) but also to **climate change**, as rotting food in landfills emits harmful greenhouse gases.# SDG-Food-Waste-App-Tracker
